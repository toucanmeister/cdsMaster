a) 
foo( 8 ) is called.
	b is declared and assigned 1.
	c is declared.
	the function f is defined.
	the function g is defined.
	c is assigned c + g( d - b ).
	which evaluates to c + g( 1 ).
	which calls g( 1 ).
		c is assigned f( x-b ).
		which calls f ( 0 ).
			b (local to f) is declared and assigned 0 + 1.
			f returns b, which evaluates to 1.
		c is thus assigned 1.
		g returns c + a, which evaluates to 9.
	c is thus assigned c + 9, which evaluates to 10.
	foo returns c, which evaluates to 10.
