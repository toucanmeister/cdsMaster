Project 1: TrophNiche by Maria Alejandra Parre√±o
-------------------------------------------------
05.06. - I contact Alejandra, asking for a meeting
06.06. - Alejandra responds, offering the morning of the 9th as the meeting time, and questing the DMP questions to prepare
07.06. - I send her the compiled questions and answer that the 9th wont work for me, sending my schedule for the next week to allow her to pick an appointment
13.06. - Alejandra responds that she will try to answer the questions on her own and contact me if she needs help
13.06. - I respond that this is fine, but that she should aim for the 22nd as a deadline so we still have a week's time for a meeting if one is needed
19.06. - Alejandra sends me her answers to the DMP questions along with a note that she is very busy and that a meeting will be quite difficult to arrange
24.06. - I fill in the answers in RDMO and inform Alejandra about a few questions that will need clearer answers in the future along with advice on how to answer them
27.06. - Alejandra sends me her answers to the questions and I add them to the DMP in RDMO
